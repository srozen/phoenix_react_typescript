# Phoenix React Typescript

Minimal setup of TypeScript React on a fresh Phoenix app (v1.6)

## How-To

- Phoenix comes bundled with Esbuild, as you can see in your configuration file and the presence of the 
Elixir package in your mix file, in fact most of the work is already done for you.
- Install needed libraries in the assets folder.
- Import your React code in the main `app.js` and you are good to go.
